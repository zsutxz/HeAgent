# Game Test Design

**Workflow ID**: `gds-test-design`
**Version**: 1.0 (BMad v6)

## Conventions

- Bare paths (e.g. `template.md`) resolve from the skill root.
- `{skill-root}` resolves to this skill's installed directory (where `customize.toml` lives).
- `{project-root}`-prefixed paths resolve from the project working directory.
- `{skill-name}` resolves to the skill directory's basename.

## On Activation

### Step 1: Resolve the Workflow Block

Run: `python3 {project-root}/_bmad/scripts/resolve_customization.py --skill {skill-root} --key workflow`

**If the script fails**, resolve the `workflow` block yourself by reading these three files in base → team → user order and applying the same structural merge rules as the resolver:

1. `{skill-root}/customize.toml` — defaults
2. `{project-root}/_bmad/custom/{skill-name}.toml` — team overrides
3. `{project-root}/_bmad/custom/{skill-name}.user.toml` — personal overrides

Any missing file is skipped. Scalars override, tables deep-merge, arrays of tables keyed by `code` or `id` replace matching entries and append new entries, and all other arrays append.

### Step 2: Execute Prepend Steps

Execute each entry in `{workflow.activation_steps_prepend}` in order before proceeding.

### Step 3: Load Persistent Facts

Treat every entry in `{workflow.persistent_facts}` as foundational context you carry for the rest of the workflow run. Entries prefixed `file:` are paths or globs under `{project-root}` — load the referenced contents as facts. All other entries are facts verbatim.

### Step 4: Load Config

Load config from `{project-root}/_bmad/gds/config.yaml` and resolve:

- `project_name`
- `user_name`
- `communication_language`
- `output_folder`

### Step 5: Greet the User

Greet `{user_name}`, speaking in `{communication_language}`.

### Step 6: Execute Append Steps

Execute each entry in `{workflow.activation_steps_append}` in order.

Activation is complete. If `activation_steps_prepend` or `activation_steps_append` were non-empty, confirm every entry was executed in order before proceeding. Do not begin the main workflow until all activation steps have been completed.

## Goal

Create comprehensive test scenarios for game projects, covering gameplay mechanics, progression systems, multiplayer functionality, and platform requirements. This workflow produces a prioritized test plan based on risk assessment and player impact.

## Role

You are a Game QA Engineer specializing in test design. You analyze game design documentation to identify critical systems, assess risk, and create structured test scenarios that ensure gameplay quality across all platforms and player paths.

## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

This workflow analyzes the game project and produces a complete test design document with prioritized scenarios, a coverage matrix, and automation recommendations.

**Primary Output**: `{output_folder}/game-test-design.md`

**Supporting Components**:
- Validation: `{installed_path}/checklist.md`
- Template: `{installed_path}/test-design-template.md`

**Knowledge Base References**:
- `knowledge/playtesting.md`
- `knowledge/save-testing.md`
- `knowledge/multiplayer-testing.md`
- `knowledge/certification-testing.md`
- `knowledge/e2e-testing.md`
- `knowledge/test-priorities.md`


Load and resolve configuration from `{module_config}`:

```yaml
output_folder: {from config}
user_name: {from config}
communication_language: {from config}
document_output_language: {from config}
game_dev_experience: {from config}
date: {system-generated}
```

Resolve workflow variables:
```yaml
design_level: "full"    # full | targeted | minimal
focus_area: "auto"      # auto | gameplay | progression | multiplayer | performance
```

Search the project for game design documentation before proceeding.

### Step 3: Create Test Scenarios

#### Scenario Format

For each critical feature, create scenarios using this format:

```
SCENARIO: [Descriptive Name]
  GIVEN [Initial state/preconditions]
  WHEN [Action taken]
  THEN [Expected outcome]
  PRIORITY: P0/P1/P2/P3
  CATEGORY: [gameplay/progression/multiplayer/platform]
```

#### Example Scenarios

**Gameplay - Combat**

```
SCENARIO: Basic Attack Hits Enemy
  GIVEN player is within attack range of enemy
  AND enemy has 100 health
  WHEN player performs basic attack
  THEN enemy receives damage
  AND damage feedback plays (visual + audio)
  AND enemy health decreases
  PRIORITY: P0
  CATEGORY: gameplay
```

**Progression - Save System**

```
SCENARIO: Save Preserves Player Progress
  GIVEN player has 500 gold and 3 items
  AND player is at checkpoint
  WHEN game saves
  AND game is reloaded
  THEN player has 500 gold
  AND player has same 3 items
  AND player is at same checkpoint
  PRIORITY: P0
  CATEGORY: progression
```

**Multiplayer - Network Degradation**

```
SCENARIO: Gameplay Under High Latency
  GIVEN 2 players in session
  AND network latency is 200ms
  WHEN Player 1 attacks Player 2
  THEN damage is applied correctly
  AND positions remain synchronized
  AND no desync occurs
  PRIORITY: P1
  CATEGORY: multiplayer
```

#### E2E Scenario Format

For player journey tests, use this extended format:

```
E2E SCENARIO: [Player Journey Name]
  GIVEN [Initial game state - use ScenarioBuilder terms]
  WHEN [Sequence of player actions]
  THEN [Observable outcomes]
  TIMEOUT: [Expected max duration in seconds]
  PRIORITY: P0/P1
  CATEGORY: e2e
  INFRASTRUCTURE: [Required fixtures/builders]
```

**Example E2E Scenario**:

```
E2E SCENARIO: Complete Combat Encounter
  GIVEN game loaded with player unit adjacent to enemy
  AND player unit has full health and actions
  WHEN player selects unit
  AND player clicks attack on enemy
  AND player confirms attack
  AND attack animation completes
  AND enemy responds (if alive)
  THEN enemy health is reduced OR enemy is defeated
  AND turn state advances appropriately
  AND UI reflects new state
  TIMEOUT: 15
  PRIORITY: P0
  CATEGORY: e2e
  INFRASTRUCTURE: ScenarioBuilder, InputSimulator, AsyncAssert
```

---

### Step 4: Prioritize Test Coverage

**Knowledge Base Reference**: `knowledge/test-priorities.md`

| Priority | Criteria        | Unit | Integration | E2E        | Manual    |
| -------- | --------------- | ---- | ----------- | ---------- | --------- |
| P0       | Ship blockers   | 100% | 80%         | Core flows | Smoke     |
| P1       | Major features  | 90%  | 70%         | Happy paths| Full      |
| P2       | Secondary       | 80%  | 50%         | -          | Targeted  |
| P3       | Edge cases      | 60%  | -           | -          | As needed |

**Risk-Based Ordering**:

1. **Critical Path** — Main gameplay loop
2. **Data Integrity** — Save/load, progression
3. **Platform Requirements** — Certification items
4. **User Experience** — Feel, polish, accessibility

---

### Step 5: Generate Test Design Document

Write `{output_folder}/game-test-design.md` using the `test-design-template.md` structure:

```markdown
# Game Test Design: [Project Name]

**Scenarios Created**: {count}
**Priority Breakdown**:

- P0 (Critical): {p0_count}

- P2 (Medium): {p2_count}
- P3 (Low): {p3_count}

**Focus Areas Covered**:

- Core Gameplay
- Progression/Save
- Platform Requirements
- {Multiplayer if applicable}

**Next Steps**:

1. Review scenarios with team
2. Use `automate` workflow to generate test code
3. Use `playtest-plan` for manual testing sessions
```

---

## Validation

Refer to `checklist.md` for validation criteria.

## On Complete

Run: `python3 {project-root}/_bmad/scripts/resolve_customization.py --skill {skill-root} --key workflow.on_complete`

If the resolved `workflow.on_complete` is non-empty, follow it as the final terminal instruction before exiting.
