# Game Technical Research Step 3: Game Integration Patterns

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without web search verification

- 📖 CRITICAL: ALWAYS read the complete step file before taking any action - partial understanding leads to incomplete decisions
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure the entire file is read and understood before proceeding
- ✅ Search the web to verify and supplement your knowledge with current facts
- 📋 YOU ARE A GAME INTEGRATION ANALYST, not content generator
- 💬 FOCUS on online services, platform APIs, analytics, and game system interoperability
- 🔍 WEB SEARCH REQUIRED - verify current facts against live sources
- 📝 WRITE CONTENT IMMEDIATELY TO DOCUMENT
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Show web search analysis before presenting findings
- ⚠️ Present [C] continue option after integration patterns content generation
- 📝 WRITE GAME INTEGRATION PATTERNS ANALYSIS TO DOCUMENT IMMEDIATELY
- 💾 ONLY proceed when user chooses C (Continue)
- 📖 Update frontmatter `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3]` before loading next step
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to load next step until C is selected

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Current document and frontmatter from previous steps are available
- **Research topic = "{{research_topic}}"** - established from initial discussion
- **Research goals = "{{research_goals}}"** - established from initial discussion
- Focus on online services, platform APIs, analytics, and game system interoperability
- Web search capabilities with source verification are enabled

## YOUR TASK:

Conduct game integration patterns analysis focusing on online services, platform APIs, game backend systems, and system interoperability. Search the web to verify and supplement current facts.

## GAME INTEGRATION PATTERNS ANALYSIS SEQUENCE:

### 1. Begin Game Integration Patterns Analysis

**UTILIZE SUBPROCESSES AND SUBAGENTS**: Use research subagents, subprocesses or parallel processing if available to thoroughly analyze different game integration areas simultaneously and thoroughly.

Start with game integration patterns research approach:
"Now I'll conduct **game integration patterns analysis** for **{{research_topic}}** to understand game system integration approaches.

**Game Integration Patterns Focus:**

- Online multiplayer and networking service integration
- Platform achievement, leaderboard, and social API integration
- Game analytics and telemetry systems
- Live service backend and game operations infrastructure
- Anti-cheat and fair play enforcement integration

**Let me search for current game integration patterns insights.**"

### 2. Parallel Game Integration Patterns Research Execution

**Execute multiple web searches simultaneously:**

Search the web: "{{research_topic}} game online services multiplayer backend"
Search the web: "{{research_topic}} platform API achievements leaderboards integration"
Search the web: "{{research_topic}} game analytics telemetry live operations"
Search the web: "{{research_topic}} game anti-cheat security integration"

**Analysis approach:**

- Look for game backend service documentation (PlayFab, GameSparks, Nakama, etc.)
- Search for platform SDK documentation (Steam API, PSN SDK, Xbox Live, etc.)
- Research game analytics platform documentation and best practices
- Analyze live service operations infrastructure patterns
- Study anti-cheat and security integration approaches

### 3. Analyze and Aggregate Results

**Collect and analyze findings from all parallel searches:**

"After executing comprehensive parallel web searches, let me analyze and aggregate game integration patterns findings:

**Research Coverage:**

- Online services and multiplayer backend analysis
- Platform API and achievement system integration
- Game analytics and telemetry patterns
- Live service operations and anti-cheat integration

**Cross-Integration Analysis:**
[Identify patterns connecting backend service choices, platform APIs, and analytics systems]

**Quality Assessment:**
[Overall confidence levels and research gaps identified]"

### 4. Generate Game Integration Patterns Content

**WRITE IMMEDIATELY TO DOCUMENT**

Prepare game integration patterns analysis with web search citations:

### 6. Handle Continue Selection

#### If 'C' (Continue):

- **CONTENT ALREADY WRITTEN TO DOCUMENT**
- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3]`
- Load: `./step-04-architectural-patterns.md`

## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:

Content is already written to document when generated in step 4. No additional append needed.

## SUCCESS METRICS:

✅ Online multiplayer and backend service options thoroughly analyzed
✅ Platform API and achievement system integration evaluated
✅ Game analytics and telemetry patterns documented
✅ Live service operations infrastructure mapped
✅ Anti-cheat and security integration strategies identified
✅ Content written immediately to document
✅ [C] continue option presented and handled correctly
✅ Proper routing to next step (architectural patterns)
✅ Research goals alignment maintained

## FAILURE MODES:

❌ Relying solely on training data without web verification for current game tech facts

❌ Missing critical online service or backend patterns
❌ Incomplete platform API or analytics integration analysis
❌ Not identifying anti-cheat or security integration approaches
❌ Not writing content immediately to document
❌ Not presenting [C] continue option after content generation
❌ Not routing to architectural patterns step

❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions
❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file
❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols

## GAME INTEGRATION PATTERNS RESEARCH PROTOCOLS:

- Research game backend service documentation and best practice guides
- Use platform SDK documentation as primary source for platform API details
- Analyze live service game case studies and post-mortems
- Study anti-cheat and security integration patterns from GDC talks
- Focus on current game integration data
- Present conflicting information when sources disagree
- Apply confidence levels appropriately

## GAME INTEGRATION PATTERNS ANALYSIS STANDARDS:

- Always cite URLs for web search results
- Use authoritative game integration research sources
- Note data currency and potential limitations
- Present multiple perspectives when sources conflict
- Apply confidence levels to uncertain data
- Focus on actionable game integration insights

## NEXT STEP:

After user selects 'C', load `./step-04-architectural-patterns.md` to analyze game architectural patterns, engine design decisions, and system structures for {{research_topic}}.

Remember: Always write research content to document immediately and emphasize current game integration data with rigorous source verification!
