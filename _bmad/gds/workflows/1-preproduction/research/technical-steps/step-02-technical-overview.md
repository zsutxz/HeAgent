## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Current document and frontmatter from step-01 are available
- **Research topic = "{{research_topic}}"** - established from initial discussion
- **Research goals = "{{research_goals}}"** - established from initial discussion
- Focus on game engines, languages, middleware, tools, and platforms
- Web search capabilities with source verification are enabled

## YOUR TASK:

Conduct game technology stack analysis focusing on game engines, programming languages, middleware, tools, and platforms. Search the web to verify and supplement current facts.

## GAME TECHNOLOGY STACK ANALYSIS SEQUENCE:

### 1. Begin Game Technology Stack Analysis

**UTILIZE SUBPROCESSES AND SUBAGENTS**: Use research subagents, subprocesses or parallel processing if available to thoroughly analyze different game technology stack areas simultaneously and thoroughly.

Start with game technology stack research approach:
"Now I'll conduct **game technology stack analysis** for **{{research_topic}}** to understand the game technology landscape.

**Game Technology Stack Focus:**

- Game engines and their evolution (Unreal, Unity, Godot, proprietary)
- Programming languages and scripting (C++, C#, GDScript, Lua, Blueprint)
- Middleware and specialized game tech (physics, audio, animation, networking)
- Game development tools and pipelines (IDEs, profilers, asset pipelines)
- Target platform SDKs and deployment infrastructure

**Let me search for current game technology stack insights.**"

### 2. Parallel Game Technology Stack Research Execution

**Execute multiple web searches simultaneously:**

Search the web: "{{research_topic}} game engine technology comparison"
Search the web: "{{research_topic}} game development tools middleware"
Search the web: "{{research_topic}} game audio physics networking solutions"
Search the web: "{{research_topic}} game platform SDK deployment"

**Analysis approach:**

- Look for recent game developer surveys (Unity/Unreal state of game dev, GDC surveys)
- Search for game engine documentation, feature comparisons, and licensing details
- Research middleware and specialized tech choices in comparable games
- Analyze game development tool ecosystems and their evolution
- Study platform SDK requirements and deployment considerations

### 3. Analyze and Aggregate Results

**Collect and analyze findings from all parallel searches:**

"After executing comprehensive parallel web searches, let me analyze and aggregate game technology stack findings:

**Research Coverage:**

- Game engine and rendering framework analysis
- Programming language and scripting evaluation
- Middleware and specialized game tech assessment
- Game development tools and pipeline analysis

**Cross-Technology Analysis:**
[Identify patterns connecting engine choices, language decisions, and platform requirements]

**Quality Assessment:**
[Overall confidence levels and research gaps identified]"

### 4. Generate Game Technology Stack Content

**WRITE IMMEDIATELY TO DOCUMENT**

Prepare game technology stack analysis with web search citations:

#### Content Structure:

When saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:

### 5. Present Analysis and Continue Option

**Show analysis and present continue option:**

"I've completed **game technology stack analysis** of the technology landscape for {{research_topic}}.

**Key Game Technology Stack Findings:**

- Game engines and rendering frameworks thoroughly analyzed
- Programming languages and scripting options evaluated
- Middleware and specialized game tech documented
- Game development tools and pipeline options mapped
- Platform SDK and deployment infrastructure requirements identified

**Ready to proceed to game integration patterns analysis?**
[C] Continue - Save this to document and proceed to integration patterns

### 6. Handle Continue Selection

#### If 'C' (Continue):

- **CONTENT ALREADY WRITTEN TO DOCUMENT**
- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2]`
- Load: `./step-03-integration-patterns.md`

## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:

Content is already written to document when generated in step 4. No additional append needed.

## SUCCESS METRICS:

✅ Game engines and rendering frameworks thoroughly analyzed
✅ Programming languages and scripting options evaluated
✅ Middleware and specialized game tech documented
✅ Game development tools and pipeline options mapped
✅ Platform SDK and deployment infrastructure identified
✅ Content written immediately to document
✅ [C] continue option presented and handled correctly
✅ Proper routing to next step (integration patterns)
✅ Research goals alignment maintained

## FAILURE MODES:

❌ Relying solely on training data without web verification for current game tech facts

❌ Missing critical game engines or rendering frameworks
❌ Incomplete middleware or platform SDK analysis
❌ Not identifying game development tools and pipeline options
❌ Not writing content immediately to document
❌ Not presenting [C] continue option after content generation
❌ Not routing to integration patterns step

❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions
❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file
❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols

## GAME TECHNOLOGY STACK RESEARCH PROTOCOLS:

- Research game developer surveys and state-of-the-industry reports
- Use game engine documentation, feature comparisons, and community forums
- Analyze middleware provider documentation and game use cases
- Study game development tool ecosystems and pipeline examples
- Focus on current game technology data
- Present conflicting information when sources disagree
- Apply confidence levels appropriately

## GAME TECHNOLOGY STACK ANALYSIS STANDARDS:

- Always cite URLs for web search results
- Use authoritative game technology research sources
- Note data currency and potential limitations
- Present multiple perspectives when sources conflict
- Apply confidence levels to uncertain data
- Focus on actionable game technology insights

## NEXT STEP:

After user selects 'C', load `./step-03-integration-patterns.md` to analyze online service integration, platform APIs, analytics, and game system interoperability for {{research_topic}}.

Remember: Always write research content to document immediately and emphasize current game technology data with rigorous source verification!
